# Project draft
## Description of the problem
The field of my research is music. I wanted to anaylze my music taste with the help of datamining. I want to see if it is possible to isolate distinctive features in the genres and artists I gravitate towards. The main goal of this project is to get better insight into my music taste, find trends and patterns in my listening habits, discover how diverse (or homogenous) my taste is and learn which musical properties influence my liking of a song. 
## Data
The data will be collected from my Spotify account using their API and python tools for scraping song information. I will collect the basic attributes of a song such as the name, artist, release date as well as deeper metadata and musical features.
