# Project draft
## Description of the problem
The field of my research is music. I want to explore music industry trends in the past few years, from 2006 to 2020. I want to see how popularity of genres changes through the years, where does popular music come frome and who the most popular artists are. I want to see if specific countries prefer listening to certain genres or artists and if there is any correlation with the music those countries produce. I would also like to answer the question whether times of crisis have an impact on music trends. 
## Data
I will use different sources to compile my data. My plan is scrape data from some/all of these sources: last.fm, Wikipedia, Spotify, MusicBrainz. The data I need is artist name, genre, release date, country of origin, and number of listeners/scrobbles.
